## About the Video Course
There is often a need to test your web applications against a vast number of browsers and platforms due to their increasing complexity. For this, you need to build highly reliable and maintainable test automation cases. Here's where Selenium comes in â€“ it is one of the most easy-to-implement and efficient solutions for this.

"Learning Selenium Testing Tools" will help software testers to get up and running with Selenium. This course will help beginner testers to start learning right from the Selenium Tool installation. It will show you how to use the Selenium tool and take you through installing the Selenium IDE. Next, you will then move on to learning all about Selenium locators and be empowered to locate web elements in different ways. The automation framework development architecture will help in building our very own frame work and thus enable us to develop test scripts easily.


This video course is jam-packed with practical, real-world examples that will skill you up and increase your daily productivity.
